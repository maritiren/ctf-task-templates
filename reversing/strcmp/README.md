# RE strcmp task

This task template is made from one of the reversing for beginners workshop 
with UiO-CTF.

It is meant to give a binary file to the contestants, and then host the binary
on a server. The server has the flag in a file called `flag.txt`. 

This way, the
contestants can reverse engineer the binary and find the right answer to the 
question asked on the server.
